# Shower & Supplies Adventure

A web-based game inspired by the real-life operations of Hope's Corner, where you manage a shower and supply station for guests in need. Adapt to daily events, keep stress low, and serve as many guests as possible!

## Gameplay

- **Manage Guests:** Drag waiting guests (ðŸ˜Š) to available shower stalls.
- **Clean Showers:** Click dirty showers (ðŸ§¹) to clean them and make them available again.
- **Fulfill Requests:** After showering, guests will request specific items. Click the requested item icon to give it to them (if you have it in stock).
- **Watch Out:** Serve guests before they become upset (ðŸ˜ ). Keep an eye on the stress bar and daily events for new challenges.

# Shower & Supplies Game

A web-based game inspired by the real-life operations of Hope's Corner, where you manage a shower, laundry, and supplies for guests in need. Adapt to daily events, keep stress low, and serve as many guests as possible!

## Gameplay

- **Accept Supply Drops:** Click "Accept Donations" to receive new items, then drag them to the correct supply bins.
- **Manage Guests:** Drag waiting guests (ðŸ˜Š) to available shower stalls or laundry machines as needed.
- **Laundry Service:** Some guests will need to use the laundry. Drag guests waiting for laundry (ðŸ«§ for washing, ðŸ”¥ for drying) to the appropriate machine. After washing, move them to the dryer. Once laundry is done, fulfill their item requests.
- **Clean Showers & Laundry Machines:** Click dirty showers (ðŸ§¹) or laundry machines to clean them and make them available again.
- **Fulfill Requests:** After showering or laundry, guests will request specific items. Click the requested item icon to give it to them (if you have it in stock).
- **Call Volunteers:** When overwhelmed, click "Call Volunteers" (costs 50 points) to instantly clean all dirty showers and laundry machines, auto-sort all unsorted supplies, and reduce stress for a short time. Volunteers can only be called when you have enough points and are not already active.
- **Watch Out:** Serve guests before they become upset (ðŸ˜ ). Keep an eye on the stress bar and daily events for new challenges.

## Features

- Dynamic daily events that change gameplay (e.g., rain, supply shortages, bonus points).
- Combo/streak system for efficient play.
- Drag-and-drop interface for supplies, guests, and laundry.
- Progress bars for stress, guest patience, showering, laundry, and cleaning.
- Sound effects and visual feedback.
- **Laundry Feature:** Guests may require laundry service. Assign them to the washer, then the dryer, before fulfilling their requests. Laundry machines can become dirty and need cleaning, just like showers.
- **Volunteers Needed Feature:** Call in volunteers to help when things get tough. Volunteers instantly clean all dirty showers and laundry machines, auto-sort all unsorted supplies, and reduce your stress for 8 seconds. The button is disabled while volunteers are active or if you don't have enough points.
